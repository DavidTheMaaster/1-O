![](logowatermelonsquad.png)

Thanks for checking out our game. We are David Lozano and Joan Valiente from CITM.

1-O is a platformer game made for the Game Development 1 subject from UPC-CITM. The main goal of this assignment is
to create a simple platformer with two levels created with Tiled.



In 1-O you're a guy from Catalonia and your objective is to arrive to the end of the levels to vote.


Make it as fast as you can, collecting every urn and finishing with all your enemies to make more points!.
